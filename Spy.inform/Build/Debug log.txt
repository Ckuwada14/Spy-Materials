Problem C8RuleWithoutColon issued from Chapter 8/Traverse for Assertions.w, line 300

  >--> You wrote 'Instead o Understand "combine [shoelace] with [thumtack]" as
    combining it with' (source text, line 12): but I can't find a verb that I
    know how to deal with, so can't do anything with this sentence. It looks as
    if it might be a rule definition, but if so then it is lacking the
    necessary colon (or comma). The punctuation style for rules is 'Rule
    conditions: do this; do that; do some more.' Perhaps you used a full stop
    instead of the colon?

    Problem C8ChalkCheese issued from Chapter 8/Make Assertions.w, line 1339

      >--> The sentence 'It is a closed-openable container' (source text, line 20)
        appears to say two things are the same - I am reading 'It' and
        'closed-openable container' as two different things, and therefore it makes
        no sense to say that one is the other: it would be like saying that 'the
        hawk is the handsaw'. It would be all right if the second thing were the
        name of a kind, perhaps with properties: for instance 'Elsinore is a
        lighted room' says that something called Elsinore exists and that it is a
        'room', which is a kind I know about, combined with a property called
        'lighted' which I also know about.

Problem C8NameWithText issued from Chapter 8/The Creator.w, line 464
(Assertion error: looking for alternative verbs in <the description of the room is "
Alley is a room. It is east of the entrance. The description of the room is " 2>.)

  >--> You wrote 'The description of the room is " Alley is a room. It is east
    of th [...] e. The description of the room is " 2' (source text, line 27):
    but this seems to give something a name which contains double-quoted text,
    which is not allowed. If you do need quotes in a name, one option would be
    to write something like 'In the Saloon is 'Black' Jacques Bernoulli.'; but
    this problem message is often caused by an accident in punctuation, in
    which case you never intended to create an object - you thought that the
    text ended a sentence because it finished with sentence-ending punctuation,
    when in fact it didn't, so that I read the next words as following on.
